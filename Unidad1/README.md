Video 1 reviews.
-----------------


In the video he explains that what is a distributed system, in which he recommends not doing centralized systems, these have their advantages and disadvantages

The centralized systems are low cost, easy to understand and fast for a simple user.

The disadvantages are that if the connection to the system is lost, you will no longer be able to access the information inside.

Distributed systems are fault tolerant, if the connection with one is lost, you have access to the information.
They are scales, that is, it can support more than one user.



































































Video 1: What is a distributed system?
---------------------------------------




Explain distributed system part two
-----------------------------------
In the video he explains that a more complex system does not make it a disadvantage, since that helps to make it more secure and reliable.
Mention that Facebook and Google use distributed systems since you have to be mass scalable, they have to be fast and very safe.
If we send an email and it reaches a server that is failing, it will not be sent. But this will not happen to everyone who sends an email, but the other emails that are sent are sent to other ser





video 2: It explains why we should create a distributed system.

10. You should know the reasons why you should create a distributed system.
9. Because it's fun and it's because it's your job to create better solutions.
8. You will need a force server to solve problems that you cannot do simply with a simple computer. Explain that if you handle an application or chat and require information sharing, the server will also be necessary.
7. You need policies in the distributed system (rules).
6. You must create a system proportional to the users who use it, you should not make a system too expensive if you will not take advantage.


Continuing with the video 2 summary


5. You must create a trust-based system and have a good design implemented.

4. PERFORMANCE: You must have a distributed system established in a place where customers do not suffer from weak coverage. The closer it is the better.

3. You must depend on a cloud service, it is not necessary to have a system distributed with 2 carriers.

2. You must have a distributed system with good support, not only on a single computer, but more so that it is safer and thus avoid problems

1. You must create a scalable distributed system, to avoid problems in the future and thus improve your performance and reduce costs. It only applies if you really know what it will take in the future

You should always know why you are going to create a distributed system, but you will only do a job for nothing.

Thats all.
